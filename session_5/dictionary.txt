DICTIONARY

Syntax:
    dictionary_name = [key:"value"]
        Example: students = ["Yara":111]

- Key is primary key / unique
- Value can be any data type
- Keys can only be imutable data types

“mutable” and “immutable” refer to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created
Imutable means single unit data types - e.g. strings, floats, booleans

An object is considered mutable if its state or value can be modified after it is created. This means that you can alter its internal data or attributes without creating a new object. Examples of mutable objects in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets. If you modify a mutable object, any references to that object will reflect the changes.
