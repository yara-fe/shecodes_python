# Question 1:
# Ask the user for a number.
# Use for loop to print the multiplication table for that number.

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# for x in range(10):
#     x =+ 1 #add 1 to the number in range because range starts with 0
#     product = number * x
#     print(number,"*",x,"=",product)

# Question 2:
# Ask the user for an integer.
# Use a for loop to add up every number from 0 up to that integer. Print the result

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# sum = 0

# for x in range(1, number+1):
#     sum = sum + x
# print(sum)

# Question 3:
# Save a list of numbers to a variable.
# Then use a for loop to print the sum of all the numbers in the list

# declare a list
my_numbers = []
sum = 0
for numbers in my_numbers:
    sum = sum + numbers
    
print(sum)
